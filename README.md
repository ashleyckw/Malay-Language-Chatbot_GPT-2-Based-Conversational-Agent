# Malay-Language-Chatbot_GPT-2-Based-Conversational-Agent
This project focuses on developing a Malay Language Chatbot using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model. The chatbot employs GoogleTrans for real-time translation between Malay and English. It is designed to understand and generate contextually coherent responses through NLP techniques, such as tokenization, attention mechanisms, and perplexity scoring.

## Key Features
* GPT-2 Fine-Tuning: The chatbot is built using the GPT-2 model, fine-tuned on a specific conversational dataset to generate context-aware responses.
* NLP Integration: Utilized tokenization, attention mechanisms, and scoring functions like perplexity and average loss to evaluate and improve chatbot performance.
* Real-time Translation: Integrated GoogleTrans to enable translation between Malay and English, expanding the chatbotâ€™s multilingual capabilities.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* GPT-2 (via Hugging Face)
* GoogleTrans (Translation API)
* PyTorch
* NLP Techniques (Tokenization, Perplexity Scoring)

## Project Impact
This project demonstrates the potential of transformer-based models in developing chatbots for underrepresented languages like Malay. By leveraging Generative AI and NLP techniques, this chatbot can be expanded to serve various industries needing multilingual support.
